  <description>This mod makes big fluffy pink rabbits (hares). This mutant Hare is easily spotted since it is huge and pink, possible arising from some strange things involving a rabbit, rum, and a Megasloth. The extra fluff makes them sturdy in the cold and the duller under-fluff can be sheared.  They're strangely bright and can be trained.</description>
